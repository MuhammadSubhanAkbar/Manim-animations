# Enhanced Pendulum Simulation (Manim)

This project is a **visual simulation of a simple pendulum** built using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/).  
It demonstrates how the time period of a pendulum depends only on its **length (L)** and **gravitational acceleration (g)**, but not on its amplitude (for small oscillations).

## ðŸŽ¥ Features
- Animated pendulum motion with adjustable parameters.  
- Real-time display of:
  - **Time** (in seconds)  
  - **Period count**  
  - **Angle (Î¸)** in degrees  
- Dynamic **energy bars** showing conversion between kinetic and potential energy.  
- **Traced path** of the pendulum bob.  
- Visualization of the **pendulum formula**:  
  \[
  T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
  \]
- Introductory and concluding text for conceptual clarity.
